It is based on An Introduction to Spatial Analysis and Mapping by Brunsdon and Comber (2018) (link here) which provides a foundation for spatial data handling, GIS-related operations and spatial analysis in R.\nThere is a chapter for each practical and each has the same structure, containing:\nEach chapter is self contained and with instructions for loading and data and packages as needed and some have an additional optional exercise that extend the technique being illustrated or describe important related approaches.\nThe sequence of practicals and topics will build as we porgress through the module\nThe aim of this week’s practial is to make sure that you are able to access RStudio, have a secure understanding of some core concepts related to deate structures and data operations, are able to load data, export a graphic and are generally ready to go for the rest fo the module."
